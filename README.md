## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### Installation

To install NGINX, simply run the following command:

```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx

# For CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install nginx
```

# Basic Configuration

NGINX configuration files are located in /etc/nginx/. The main configuration file is nginx.conf, and site-specific configurations are typically stored in /etc/nginx/sites-available/.

Here's a simple example of a basic NGINX configuration:

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
            root /var/www/html;
            index index.html;
        }
    }

# Starting NGINX

## Once configured, start NGINX with:

    sudo systemctl start nginx

## To enable NGINX to start on boot:

    sudo systemctl enable nginx

---

## 🔧 **Configuration Highlights**

- **Environment Variable**: A custom environment variable `MY_NGINX=scor` is set for additional flexibility.
- **Health Check**: The container includes a health check to monitor NGINX's status:
  ```dockerfile
  HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
  ```

---

## 📦 **Dependencies**

- **Base Image**: Built on the official [NGINX Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx).
- **Additional Tools**:
  - `tree`: For visualizing directory structures.
  - `net-tools` and `iputils-ping`: For debugging network configurations.
